.\CreateProblemUsers.ps1


 Note: Wait until the script has completed before proceeding to the next step. 

	5. This Windows PowerShell script will make the following changes in AD DS:

		- Klemen Sic. Add the "@" character to the beginning of "M365x" for the UserPrincipalName attribute.

		- Lara Raisic. Replace the existing string with "lara@M365x.com" for the emailAddress attribute.

### Task 3: Run the IdFix tool and fix identified issues

	1. On LON-CL1, open Microsoft Edge, and then connect to https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=36832

	2. On the IdFix DirSync Error Remediation Tool page, Select Download.

	3. Wait for the download to complete, and then Select Open.

	4. In the File Explorer windows, browse to the Downloads folder, right-Select IdFix.zip, and then Select Extract All...

	5. In the Extract Compressed (Zipped) Folders dialog box, in the destination box, type C:\Deployment Tools\IdFix, and then Select Extract.

	12. In the Holly Spencer row, in the ACTION column, select EDIT. 

	13. In the Maj Hojski row, in the ACTION column, select EDIT

	14. On the toolbar, Select Apply.

	15. In the Apply Pending dialog box, Select Yes; note the COMPLETE status in the ACTION column indicating successful writes.

	16. Switch to File Explorer, and in the C:\Deployment Tools\IdFix folder, double-Select Verbose &lt;date&gt; &lt;time&gt;.txt to view the updated transactions in the transaction log. 

	17. Switch back to the IdFix tool.

	18. On the toolbar, Select Query. 

	19. Select in the UPDATE column to locate the Logan Boyle error, and replace the string with logan@M365x.com, and then in the ACTION column, select EDIT.

	20. Select in the UPDATE column to locate the Maj Hojski error, and replace the string with maj@M365x.com, and then in the ACTION column, select EDIT.

	21.  On the toolbar, Select Apply.

	22. In the Apply Pending box, Select Yes.

	23. On the toolbar, Select Query and verify that errors are corrected.

 Note: Where there are format and duplicate errors for distinguished names, the UPDATE column either contains the same string as the VALUE column, or the UPDATE column entry is blank; in either case, this means that IdFix cannot suggest a remediation for the error.

You can either fix these errors outside IdFix, or manually remediate them within IdFix. You can also export the results and use Windows PowerShell to remediate a large number of errors.

### Task 4: Configure the Office 365 tenant for directory synchronization

	1.  On LON-CL1, on the desktop, double-Select Windows Azure Active Directory Module for Windows PowerShell.

	10. On the Sign-in page, in the Name box, select Admin@M365xyyxxxxx.onmicrosoft.com. In the Password box, type Pa55w.rd, and then Select Sign in.

	11. Navigate to the Office 365 admin center.

	12. In the Office 365 admin center, Select Home and then Select Go to the old admin center to go to previous Office365 admin center.

	13. In the left navigation pane of previous Office365 admin center, Select USERS, and then Select Active users.

	14. To the right of Active Directory synchronization, verify that there is a Manage link (if activation was not yet completed this link would say “Set up”). If there is no Manage, Select Set up, and verify that under Directory synchronization the Directory sync status is activated.

	15. Select Admin in the toolbar, and then Select the banner at the top of the windows to go back to new admin center.

 


Results: After completing this exercise, you will have resolved issues in AD DS identified by the IdFix tool and you will have enabled Active Directory synchronization in Office 365.
